# Assignment 2: Part a:
### 1) I used the scan convertion method to know if the point  in the triangle, using the maximum and the minimum of the triangle coordinates. and draw the factors that inside the triangle with a random color. so we can see that the triangles in the back might be occluding triangles in the front:
and after implement the z-buffer algorithm:

### 2) after implement the z-buffer algorithm
### The work was in Renderer Class, Camera Class, Main Class. In Camera Class and Main Class the job was just to add a button to the GUI so we could switch from gray scale model to random colored model.
### The drawing function is checks every z in zbuffer if it is not infinity and draw it with gray scale that fits the z we have.
