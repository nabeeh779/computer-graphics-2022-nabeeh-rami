#### Upload more than one light source:
In order to implement the ability to add light sources to the scene, at first I added light class to implement all the needed functions when we add light, that includes: set and get to all the reflection types(ambient, diffuse, specular), direction and position of light and all the transformation function for parallel type. for GUI I added a new window for light that will be visible if the flag of light type will be 2(I added this flag in camera GUI window to separate between random color or gray or model with light), in the GUI window I added the buttons to determines the light type, reflection light type(twice, to be able to add more than one light), and I also added list box for all the light. inside the render I draw the mild  in keeping with  the location and the route of the mild and in keeping with the light  type, and put in force the calculation of each  kind  reflection.
