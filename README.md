## Project Overview

This project is a culmination of a Computer Graphics course aimed at introducing the foundations of graphics programming. The goal of this project is to develop a **Basic Model Viewer** using **C++** and **OpenGL**. This viewer allows users to load and interact with 3D models while applying various transformations and shading techniques.

By the end of this project, the following objectives are achieved:

- **Understand** and apply fundamental mathematical concepts used in 2D and 3D rendering.
- **Implement** a basic graphics pipeline based on rasterization.
- **Develop** a simple model viewer with capabilities for loading, displaying, and transforming 3D models.

## Key Features

- **2D and 3D Transformations**: Rotate, translate, and scale 3D models.
- **Shading Models**: Implement Phong and Gouraud shading to enhance visual realism.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Create a basic rendering pipeline based on rasterization techniques.
- **User Interaction**: Use keyboard and mouse input for manipulating the model and camera view.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core language for graphics programming.
- **OpenGL**: Used for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- **GLSL**: OpenGL Shading Language for writing vertex and fragment shaders.
- **GLFW**: Library for managing windows and handling user input.
- **GLAD**: OpenGL loader generator to manage OpenGL extensions.
- **GLM**: A C++ mathematics library for graphics programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- A **C++ compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **OpenGL** libraries and drivers
- **CMake** (Optional, for building the project)
- **GLFW** for window and context creation
- **GLAD** for loading OpenGL functions
- **GLM** for handling vector and matrix operations
